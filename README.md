### Problem statement

Auth service is responsible for authentication and authorization of incoming requests from the Templatisation service and API Gateway.

### ✨ Functional Requirements

- User should be able to Sign up and login
- User would not be asked to login everytime whenever he/she opens the app
- Store encrypted passwords in the database
- Access tokens and refresh tokens should be allotted
- Tokens should be passed over HTTPs requests
- Event published to userService should be recoverable and fault tolerant

### ✨ Non Functional requirements

- Authentication should not take too much time to avoid app open lag
- Database should be designed in such a way to avoid the complex and LRQ

- SecurityConfig:- This class is about making Beans like applying filters that a request will go through before reaching to our controllers. Defining AuthenticationProvider and other related beans to be defined here.

- JWTFilter:- It is a filter that will be applied to every request apart from the requests which are mentioned to bypass this filter in SecurityConfig class like `/auth/v1/refreshToken, /auth/v1/signup, /auth/v1/login`
  
- AuthController:- Here we will define endpoints like `/auth/v1/signup`, `/ping`
  
- JwtService:- It is a class which will be used to generateToken, validateToken, using claims to get userName, expiration etc

- RefreshTokenService:- It is responsible for creation and validation of refresh tokens

- UserDetailsServiceImpl:- It is responsible for signing up the user, loading/fetching a user and this class will extend the `UserDetailsService` of `*org.springframework.security.core.userdetails`* package which is a spring security package.

- AuthenticationManager:- This comes from the spring boot security package that is responsible for authenticating a user based on its username and password.
